HW_01	[Due: 16 September 2025]

-- Task 1
Select one (1) field of law. You will become an "expert" in this field and will share your knowledge with the class. To begin your path to expertise, you will write, and then translate, a ~two-page account on the history of your selected field of law. The first part of the account will be dedicated to the general history of the field. The second part of the account will be dedicated to the history of the field in Mexico. For this assignment you should plan on 3 to 4 paragraphs per page for a total word count of not less than 750 words. You should provide at least three (3) references. Remember, your deliverable will be the original account, written in English, and the translation, written in Spanish. Be prepared to present and share your findings with the class. Please note that 'presenting and sharing your findings with the class' implies a somewhat informal presentation. I would expect about a 5 min overview of your findings with a focus on Mexico.

For this assignment and for all subsequent written assignments in this class (unless duly noted), we will use Marron's modified APA format. Specifically, documents will be written with:
	* Single-spaced text
	* 0.5 inch margins (left and right)
	* 12-point Times New Roman font, and
	* printed double-sided if possible
References, as needed, must be in a standard format (eg, APA). See "Marron_GeneralStyleGuide.pdf" in Teams under Class Materials.
	
Assignments must always be printed (i.e., hard copy) and submitted to the instructor on the due date (unless duly noted). Students should save copies of all assignments in PDF format.


--Task 2 
Read Grossfield's, "Language and the Law." Write a ~three paragraph summary of the paper in English and translate the summary into Spanish. The format requirements above apply.
