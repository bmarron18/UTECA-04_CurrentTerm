The first step in academic research is finding material related to your area of interest. This used to mean going to the library. Now, it's a matter of internet searching.

*Step 1
Search: "Han empire" y/o "Han dynasty" y/o "the Three Kingdoms period" in the following open-access sites:
	1. Google Scholar
		https://scholar.google.com/
	2. JSTOR
		https://www.jstor.org
		11,416 results using advanced search for Han empire
	3. Open-Access Journals (pick one)
		Journal of Chinese History 中國歷史學刊 
		https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-chinese-history/open-access
			61 results for Han dynasty in Journal of Chinese History 中國歷史學刊
		
		The Chinese Historical Review
		https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/ytcr20
			Showing 1-2 of 2 results for search: [All: han empire] AND [in Journal: The Chinese 
			Historical Review]
		
		Journal of the European Association for Chinese Studies
		https://journals.univie.ac.at/index.php/jeacs/index
		
		USC Libraries, University of Southern California, Research Guides
		Chinese Studies *: Journals
		https://libguides.usc.edu/chinese_studies/journals
	
*Step 2
From each site download one (1) academic paper in the fields of
	Art
	Archeology
	Politics
	Philosophy
	Sociology
		
*Step 3
List the citation for each of the three (3) papers in APA or MLA or Chicago style.

*Step 4
Select one (1) of the papers for presentation at a future date. For next week be prepared to tell the class which paper you selected and why.


--- Task 2
In the textbook, "Presentation Zen: Simple ideas on presentation design and delivery" (Reynolds, G. (2019), please skim through the Introduction and read Seth Godin (p. 20) and In Sum (p. 25). Answer the following questions,
	1. Do you typically use PowerPoint (or a similar software) when you are asked to give a 
	presentation? Do you like giving presentations before groups of people?
	2. What questions should you be asking about presentation design and delivery that you have not 
	asked in the past? 
	3. Do you think that, in the past, you have adhered to the suggested guidelines for dynamic 
	storytelling in presentations? 
	4. What aspects of the design and delivery process may have caused “suffering” for your audiences 
	in the past?
	
The Reynolds textbook can be found in Teams, Class Materials (Textbook_Reynolds_PresentationZen_NewRider.pdf)


--- Task 3
Read Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 of "The Joy Luck Club" and write a summary of the two chapters. Your summary should be two to three paragraphs long and must be translated into Spanish.

Spanning over four centuries, the Han dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history, and had a permanent impact on Chinese identity in later periods. It was preceded the Warring States Period. Han Fei was a philosopher and statesman in the Warring States Period.


"The intelligent ruler makes the law select men and makes no arbitrary appointment himself; he makes the law measure merits and makes no arbitrary judgment himself."

"The people in the well-ordered ages of the past upheld the public law and abandoned private strategies; they focused their intentions and unified their conduct. Everything they did was for the sake of being employed by the ruler."
			--- Han Fei (c.280 – 233 BC)

** Why investigate empires?
	1. Harari states that empires one of the three major factors in creating human cooperation (the other two being money and religion) and that we ALL are descendents of empires.
	2. The literature for this term has roots in empire.

** Academic Papers and Presentations
	1. Academic papers
	2. Presentations
		- The key principles of presentation are: 
			Restraint in preparation. 
			Simplicity in design. 
			Naturalness in delivery.
			
		- The multimedia content is simple, balanced, and beautiful.
		
		- There are many paths to designing and delivering memorable presentations.
		
		- The text-filled slide approach is common and normal, but it is not effective.
		
		- Good presenters target people’s left brain and right brain sensibilities.
		
		- Presentations are live talks enhanced by multimedia. They are about storytelling and have more in 
		common with the art of documentary film than the reading of a paper document.
