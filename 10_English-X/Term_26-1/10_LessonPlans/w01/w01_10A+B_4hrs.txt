HW_01 [Due: 18 September 2025]

NB. Homework assignments this term may be done in groups of 2 or 3 persons (recommended).

--- Task 1
The first step in academic research is finding material related to your area of interest. This used to mean going to the library. Today, it's a matter of internet searching.

*Step 1
Search: "Han empire" y/o "Han dynasty" y/o "the Three Kingdoms period" in the following open-access sites:
	1. Google Scholar
		https://scholar.google.com/
	2. JSTOR
		https://www.jstor.org
		
	3. Open-Access Journals (pick one)
		a. Journal of Chinese History 中國歷史學刊 
		https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-chinese-history/open-access
				
		b. The Chinese Historical Review
		https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/ytcr20
		
		c. Journal of the European Association for Chinese Studies
		https://journals.univie.ac.at/index.php/jeacs/index
		
		d. USC Libraries, University of Southern California, Research Guides
		Chinese Studies *: Journals
		https://libguides.usc.edu/chinese_studies/journals
	
*Step 2
From each site download one (1) academic paper. Papers will typically be in the fields of
	Art
	Archeology
	Politics
	Philosophy
	Sociology
	History
	Other?
		
*Step 3
In your homework i) list the sources you used, and ii) list the citation for each of the three (3) papers. Citation must be in APA or MLA or Chicago style. Briefly describe your experience using each site.

*Step 4
Select one (1) of the papers for presentation at a future date. For next week, be prepared to tell the class which paper you selected and why.


--- Task 2
In the textbook, "Presentation Zen: Simple ideas on presentation design and delivery" (Reynolds, G. (2019), skim through the Introduction and read Seth Godin (p. 20) and In Sum (p. 25). Answer the following questions,
	1. Do you typically use PowerPoint (or a similar software) when you are asked to give a 
	presentation? Do you like giving presentations before groups of people?
	2. What questions should you be asking about presentation design and delivery that you have not 
	asked in the past? 
	3. Do you think that, in the past, you have adhered to the suggested guidelines for dynamic 
	storytelling in presentations? 
	4. What aspects of the design and delivery process may have caused “suffering” for your audiences 
	in the past?
	
The Reynolds textbook can be found in Teams, Class Materials (Textbook_Reynolds_PresentationZen_NewRider.pdf)


--- Task 3
Read the First Preamble, Chapter 1, and Chapter 2 of "The Joy Luck Club" and write a single summary of the two chapters. Your summary should be ~three paragraphs long and must be translated into Spanish. Note that the reading includes the following:

	First Preamble: Feathers From a Thousand LI Away
		Ch. 1	o The Joy Luck Club: Jing-Mei Woo
		Ch. 2	o Scar: An-Mei Hsu

NB. Marron's modified APA format applies (see Class Materials in Teams). As always, assignments must be printed (i.e., hard copy) and submitted to the instructor on the due date (unless duly noted). Students should save copies of all assignments in PDF format.

--- Review

--- New

Spanning over four centuries, the Han dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history, and had a permanent impact on Chinese identity in later periods. It was preceded the Warring States Period. Han Fei was a philosopher and statesman in the Warring States Period.


"The intelligent ruler makes the law select men and makes no arbitrary appointment himself; he makes the law measure merits and makes no arbitrary judgment himself."

"The people in the well-ordered ages of the past upheld the public law and abandoned private strategies; they focused their intentions and unified their conduct. Everything they did was for the sake of being employed by the ruler."
			--- Han Fei (c.280 – 233 BC)

** Why investigate empires?
	1. Harari states that empires are one of the three major factors in creating human cooperation (the other two being money and religion) and that we ALL are descendents of empires.[Harari, Yuval N. (2015). Sapiens : a brief history of humankind. New York:Harper]
	
	2. The literature for this term has roots in empire. 
		“Joy Luck Club” by Amy Tan				<== China 
		“Brave New World” by Aldous Huxley		<== Britain 


** Scholarly Research on the Internet
	1. Google Scholar

As a trial, search: "Han empire"  
My results:
	1. Google Scholar: Lots of inaccessible docs and well over 30 pages of listings!
	2. JSTOR:  11,416 results using the advanced search engine
	3. Journal of Chinese History: 61 results for Han dynasty 
	3. The Chinese Historical Review: Only two results reported



** Research topics for the Han Dynasty (empire)
	Art

	Philosophy
	Sociology
	Other?


** Academic Papers and Presentations
	1. Academic papers
	2. Presentations (the Zen of Presentations, adapted from Reynolds)
		- The key principles of presentation are: 
			Restraint in preparation. 
			Simplicity in design. 
			Naturalness in delivery.
			
		- The multimedia content is simple, balanced, and beautiful.
		
		- There are many paths to designing and delivering memorable presentations.
		
		- The text-filled slide approach is common and normal, but it is not effective.
		
		- Good presenters target people’s left brain and right brain sensibilities.
		
		- Presentations are live talks enhanced by multimedia. They are about storytelling and have more 
		in common with the art of documentary film than the reading of a paper document.
